# Robotic Bin Picking

During 2009-2015, I worked on the robot bin-picking problem. The goal was to enable robot the ability to see the world and know the 6D poses of the parts in the surrondings so that a robot can pick up a part with the desired pose and assemble it into another part. Over the years, I have developed several object pose estimation algorithms including the fast directional chamfer matching and the learning to vote algorithm. Our team successfully pushed our research results into a commerical product (Mitsubishi Electric MELFA-3D system). We are honored that R&D Magazine recognized our innovation and gave the R&D 100 award in 2014.
